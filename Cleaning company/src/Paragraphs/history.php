Historically, blush has been worn by royals and the feminine upper class for hundreds of years.
Blush, when used correctly can bring out a vivid spark to our face. The application of this product was oftentimes a visible symbol of priviledge.
Blush can be found in parts all over the world it even spanned back to the Tang dynasty in China. During that time
blush was made out of dried safflower as it had a vibrant pigment which can also be used for vegetable oil in food. In addition to safflower, some blush products used cinnabar which contains toxic mercury and can be very harmful to your immune system!

Blush, is my favourite makeup product. I think it is beautiful and simple.
I love how blush can quickly make a face look alluring and colourful.

The last Queen of France, Marie Antoinette would often apply blush who is a subject of many books and films and when it comes to her use of blush she definitely isn't stingy with the product.
She used pale face powder and blush made from ingredients such as crushed red petals or extracted carmine from insects. Many women looked up to her beauty and tried to emulate her lavish, eloquent, refined look.

Queen Elizabeth I is also known to be a fan of blush and looking rather pale. Unfortunately she liked to use a toxic chemical called lead.
The side effects of lead can be neuropathy, abnormal social behavior, problems thinking and high levels of lead can lead to heart disease and many more problems.

So now we know that makeup, has a history of being toxic.
